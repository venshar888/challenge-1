I would use Terraform to provision the infrastructure. Below are the steps I have followed to spin up the infrastructure.
Create an AWS EC2 instance for hosting the WordPress application
Create an Amazon RDS instance for hosting the WordPress database
Create an Amazon S3 bucket for storing the WordPress media files
Create a security group to allow access to the EC2 instance from the internet
Create a security group to allow access to the RDS instance from the EC2 instance.


To automate the deployment of the application, I would use a configuration management tool like Ansible.
Download and install WordPress on the EC2 instance
Configure the WordPress site to use the RDS instance for the database
Configure the WordPress site to use the S3 bucket for media storage


To Productionise the solution, the following steps can be taken :
1. It is important to isolate production from other environments and use a separate AWS account for production deployments to improve security and reduce risks.
2. Use a centralized logging and monitoring solution
3. Use auto-scaling groups for EC2 instances to handle sudden spikes in traffic and ensure that the application is always available
4. Implement a backup and disaster recovery plan to protect against data loss and minimize downtime in case of a disaster.
5. Implement a network security strategy, including firewalls, security groups, and network ACLs to protect the infrastructure from unauthorized access.
